# Adonis fullstack application with crud generation in one Command

This is the fullstack boilerplate for AdonisJs, it comes pre-configured with.

1. Bodyparser
2. Session
3. Authentication
4. Web security middleware
5. CORS
6. Edge template engine
7. Lucid ORM
8. Migrations and seeds
9. make mvc

## Setup

manually clone the repo and then run `npm install`.

### Migrations

Run the following command to run startup migrations.

```bash
adonis migration:run
```

### Make MVC

Run the following command to run startup migrations.

```bash
adonis make:mvc
```
Follow the steps on the terminal.

### ToDo
* Improve the interaction language
* Generate better migarions with additional options
* Style form and grids just a little bit
* Ability to choose which models to use for login
* Make the layout just a little bit better

### How does it work
Quite Straightforward. Using hygen for templating and customizing all the steps for crud generation.
Add more templates or make these your own.
